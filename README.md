Zynx Health Grails/Groovy Bootcamp
========

This is the source code for a Grails/Groovy bootcamp I led during my Summer 2014 internship at Zynx Health.
The purpose of the bootcamp was to teach fellow interns my assigned technology.
The idea and code is adapted from Manning's Grails In Action 1st edition, which used an older version of Grails
with deprecated features.
